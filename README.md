# multi-step-form
Objective: Create a responsive multi-step form with three steps, ensuring data validation, error handling, and navigation controls using React.js. The form should persist data to local storage and enforce sequential completion of steps.

Requirements :- 

Form Structure:


Implement a multi-step form with three steps:
Step 1: Personal Information (Name, Email, Phone)
Step 2: Address Information (Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, Zip Code)
Step 3: Confirmation (Review all entered data)

Navigation and Buttons:


Use tabbed navigation to switch between steps.
Disable the back button on the first step.
Disable the next button on the last step and replace it with a submit button.

Validation:


Implement client-side validation to ensure all fields are filled before allowing navigation to the next step.
Display appropriate error messages if fields are empty or invalid (e.g., email format).
Highlight the fields with errors.

State Management:


Manage form data using React state.
Use hooks like useState and useEffect where appropriate.
Ensure state updates reflect user inputs and form navigation.

Local Storage:


Persist entered data to local storage when the user navigates between steps.
Retrieve and pre-fill form fields if the user revisits the form.

Responsive Design:

Ensure the form is responsive and works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
Use appropriate CSS and possibly a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Material UI) for layout and responsiveness.
